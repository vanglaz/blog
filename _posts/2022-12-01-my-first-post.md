I started learning Python in early this year by self taught, and in the beginning it's very difficult for me. In the beginning I learn by reading [Automate The Broing Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book. <br>

In the first and second months I learn: 
- The Basic Syntax.
- Variable.
- Flow Control.
- Functions.

You know, I tried to understand everything by reading a book and that's impossible to learning the programming by only reading a book! That made me got stressed many times. 
> Know How To Learn it's very important.

In the third month, I read a [Making Games with Python & Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame) book. By practicing read a code and typing copy a code that made me understand *"how the program working"*.

## Keep Practice And Learning!
